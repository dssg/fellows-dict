DSSG Fellows Python Data Dictionary
============

A dictionary to describe DSSG's fellows and how awesome they are. Each fellow interviews the others as an (extremely nerdy) ice-breaker. May lead to visualizations and analyses.

Steps to play along:

**1) Create a file which contains your dictionary.**

`<first_name>_<last_name>.json`

Suggested format for the dictionary is

(see `example.json`)

```
{
  "name1" : "answer",
  "name2" : "answer2"
  //etc 
}
```

or

```
{
  "name1" : {
    "question_tag1": "answer1-1",
    "question_tag2": "answer1-2",
  },
  "name2" : : {
    "question_tag1": "answer2-1",
    "question_tag2": "answer2-2"
  }
  //etc
}
```

**2) Document your name and question in this `README.md` file.
